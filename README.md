<h3><a class="anchor" id="pa"></a>Performance Analysis</h3>
<br><img width="1448" height="953" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1fc5d18-55d6-464c-a1cb-79bd351fd278" /> <br><br>



<p align=justify>
Across all training programs, employees demonstrated measurable improvement. Overall, 22% employee successfully passed the training and received a certificate. And the remaining 78%, who are denoted as "Not Passed' are not all the same; among them, 30% completed the training (some of them got certificates), 25% are in ongoing training, and 23% failed. Employees made the most progress in <strong>Customer Service</strong> and <strong>Communication Skills</strong> program. Though, employees are more engaged in <strong>Project Management</strong>(year-long training as well). Here, their performance improved by 37%. In <strong>Excel â€“ Basic To Advanced</strong>, participants showed the lowest improvement at 27%. While employees provided an average feedback score of 4.3 for this training, similar to other programs like Technical Skills and Project Management, suggesting a need to review the duration and trainer effectiveness.</p> <br>

Strongest improvements observed (Pre-Test Score vs. Post-Test Score):
-	Customer Service (+23pp)
-	Communication Skills (+21pp)
-	Technical Skills (+20pp)<br>
<p>Even in Project Management and Database Administration, employees showed significant improvement.<a href="https://github.com/Bushra1216/End-to-End-HR-Management-Training-Data-Analysis/blob/main/HR_Report.pdf"> Read more</a></p>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="pa"></a>Training Investment and Cost Efficiency</h3>
<br> <img width="1430" height="970" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64094162-1a2b-4d91-85c4-6ad06b0f89c4" /><br><br>
<p>May recorded the highest cost of $15.7K and longest duration (63 days). Because the Database Administration program, which was particularly expensive and running for 11 days in May, cost $7.5K, plus the Technical Skills training conducted for 25 days that month at $4.3K.</p>

<br> <img width="1430" height="970" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4cea5db-a162-4600-9879-97cc5bc131c7" /><br><br>
<p>
As an external program, Database Administration slightly 7.76% over of its allocated budget. On the other hand, the Project Managementâ€”an ongoing, year-long programâ€”remained within its budget of 19K. In contrast, internal programs were more cost-effective, collectively totaling around 65K compared to 30K for external programs.<a href="https://github.com/Bushra1216/End-to-End-HR-Management-Training-Data-Analysis/blob/main/HR_Report.pdf"> Read more</a>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="ext_analysis"></a>Extended Analysis: Cost, Duration and Program Performance Efficiency</h2>
<p>Performed Correlation and ROI-based performance analysis to evaluate performance growth, training cost, training duration, and budget utilization across all training programs, including the Efficiency Ratio to highlight programs that achieved the best balance between impact and budget control.</p> <br>


<h4><a class="anchor" id="ca"></a>Correlation Analysis</h4>

- Between cost & performance growth: Pearson r =  0.1491, P-value: 0.75 [There is no statistically significant relationship between cost and performance growth.
It indicates that higher spending does not always guarantee better outcomes]
- Between training duration & performance growth: Pearson r = 0.1908, P-value: 0.68 [No significant relationship between training days and performance growth]

**Interpretation:**
Both correlation shows no significant relationship between them. It indicates, higher cost or longer duration did not reliably produce greater performance improvement. Focus on what is delivered, trainer's quality, program structure or content relevance.<br>

<br>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="roi_ef"></a>ROI and Efficiency Ratio</h4>

| **Training Program** | **Cost**    | **Budget**    | **ROI per $1000**  | **Budget_Used%** | **Efficiency_Ratio** |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Communication Skills     | 9330  | 9752  | 4.5%          | 95.67%       | 0.0047           |
| Leadership Development   | 8134  | 8537  | 3.8%          | 95.3%        | 0.004            |
| Customer Service         | 13185 | 13507 | 3.3%          | 97.61%       | 0.0033           |
| Excel - Basic to Advance | 11446 | 11683 | 2.4%          | 98%          | 0.0024           |
| Technical Skills         | 16144 | 16593 | 2.2%          | 97.3%        | 0.0023           |
| Project Management       | 18229 | 18966 | 2%            | 96.11%       | 0.0021           |
| Database Administration  | 18600 | 17260 | 1.9%          | 107.76%      | 0.0018           |


<br>
<p align=justify>
From this figure, we can see that Communication Skills, Leadership Development, and Customer Service delivered the best ROI while maintaining a balanced budget discipline.
In Communication Skill approximately 4.55% performance improved per $1000 spent with producing highest efficiency ratio of 0.0047 and Leadership Development showed similar efficiency of 95.3% ROI and 95% budget used, demonstrating strong improvement per $1000 spent. Customer Service also performed well with strong ROI and balanced cost control, utilizing 97% of its budget.</p>
<p align=justify>
In contrast, Database Administration showed the lowest ROI 1.9% per $1000 and due to overspending (107.76% budget) its Efficiency Ratio dropped to (0.0018). This clearly indicating that despite the higher costs, performance benefits have not increased proportionally. Technical Skills and Excel - Basic to Advance showed moderate ROI, but Excel program need a focus on content delivery, duration and trainer efficiency.</p>
Overall, it reveals that higher spending does not always guarantee higher impactâ€”programs with skilled trainers, focused duration and structured content achieved better outcomes.<br>

<br>


<h2><a class="anchor" id="action plan"></a>Recommendations</h2>

- Establish a strategic training budget framework that aligns cost with measurable performance outcomes
- Focus on training duration, trainer selection, or delivery methods to optimize high-cost programs
- Implement a periodic evaluation process for external vendors or trainers based on participant feedback and learning effectiveness, ensuring only high-performing partners continue in future cycles.
- Conduct employee feedback or satisfaction surveys to improve the relevance of training, schedule flexibility, and trainers effectiveness
- Linking learning outcomes with productivity by tracking post-training performance and analyzing ROI for all programs may help to identify high-impact areas and eliminate low-value activities.
- Regular monitoring and variance analysis will help minimize overspending and improve cost predictability


Therefore, it can be concluded that the companyâ€™s training expenses were strategically managed and effectively utilized. By implementing those recommended actions, company can transform its training ecosystem into a strategic growth engine â€” enhancing workforce capability, maintaining cost efficiency and ensuring every training invest contributes to long-term organizational success.
